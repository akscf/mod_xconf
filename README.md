 A simple module to make scalable conferences on the Freeswitch.<br>
 The module is perfect for the scenario of few speakers and many listeners. Distributed mode provides possibilities to increase conferences capacity in real time.

# Basic featues
 - possible to work in a standalone mode
 - data exchange (with encryption) using multicast or point-to-point communication
 - truncated redundant transcoding (by reuse encoding results for the similar listeners)
 - fast lockings and maximum parallel processing
 - managing conferences by DTMF (separated profiles for admins and regular users)
 - *vad, *agc, cng (* - in testing mode)
